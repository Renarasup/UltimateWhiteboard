","body":"Ultimate Whiteboard\r\n==================\r\nA universal iOS application designed to act as a virtual whiteboard for the Ultimate Frisbee Sport. \r\nAnimations made with [Facebook's Pop animation framework](https://github.com/facebook/pop).\r\n\r\nCompatible with iOS 7.x - 8.1\r\n\r\n![Alt text](/Screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Functions\r\n* Two finger pinch to select and manipulate multiple markers\r\n* Toggle between built in formations\r\n* Keyframe animation system to record and playback tactics\r\n* Dynamically scales to fit screen sizes\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n1. Clone the repo\r\n2. With [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) installed, run `pod install` from the cloned folder. Run `pod setup` before running `pod install` if it returns an error.\r\n3. Open `Ultimate Whiteboard.xcworkspace` in XCode\r\n4. Run the project\r\n\r\n## UX Considerations\r\nThe markers will animate themselves a few points up from the original `touches` location when touched, so that the user's finger does not obstruct the display of the marker.\r\n\r\n## Work in progress\r\n* Replace placeholder buttons with proper buttons\r\n* Integrate [Everplay API](https://developers.everyplay.com) recording functionality to allow users to add commentary and share their plays on online social platforms\r\n* Expand touch area on iPad to facilitate interaction\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
